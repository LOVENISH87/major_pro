# 🧠 Recursion Visualizer with Tree Diagrams

This interactive web app helps visualize **recursive algorithms** like **Fibonacci**, **Factorial**, and **GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)** using animated tree diagrams. It allows users to step through recursive calls and returns, making recursion easier to understand and teach.

## 🔧 Features

- 📊 **Visual Tree Diagrams** – Recursive calls shown as branching trees.
- 🧩 **Step-by-Step Traversal** – View each recursive call and return with a click.
- 🧮 **Algorithms Supported**:
  - Fibonacci: `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)`
  - Factorial: `n! = n × (n-1)!`
  - GCD: `GCD(a, b) = GCD(b, a mod b)`
- 🎯 Base case and return values are visually marked.
- 📱 Responsive design, works across devices.
